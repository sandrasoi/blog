-- The job of this file is to reset all of our important database tables.
-- And add any data that is needed for the tests to run.
-- This is so that our tests, and application, are always operating from a fresh
-- database state, and that tests don't interfere with each other.

-- First, we must delete (drop) all our tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS posts;
DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS posts_id_seq;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS comments;
DROP SEQUENCE IF EXISTS comments_id_seq;

-- Then, we recreate them
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS posts_id_seq;
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    genre VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS albums_id_seq;
CREATE TABLE albums (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    release_year INTEGER,
    artist_id INTEGER
);

-- Finally, we add any records that are needed for the tests to run
INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ('Pixies', 'Rock');
INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ('ABBA', 'Pop');
INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ('Taylor Swift', 'Pop');
INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ('Nina Simone', 'Jazz');
